# How to start developing an MCP server
The code provided in [minimal_mcp_server](./minimal_mcp_server.py) is a good starting point.

But, in reality, for a super-minimal MCP server you need less code.
For example, you can remove support for JWT, if you don't need it.

Therefore:

```
from fastmcp import FastMCP

from config import (
    TRANSPORT,
    # needed only if transport is streamable-http
    HOST,
    PORT,
)

mcp = FastMCP("MCP server with few lines of code", auth=None)

#
# MCP tools definition
# add and write the code for the tools here
# mark each tool with the annotation
#
@mcp.tool
def say_the_truth(user: str) -> str:
    """
    Return a secret truth message addressed to the specified user.

    Args:
        user (str): The name or identifier of the user to whom the truth is addressed.

    Returns:
        str: A message containing a secret truth about the user.

    Examples:
        >>> say_the_truth("Luigi")
        "Luigi: Less is more!"
    """
    # here you'll put the code that reads and return the info requested
    # it is important to provide a good description of the tool in the docstring
    return f"{user}: Less is more!"

#
# Run the MCP server
#
if __name__ == "__main__":
    if TRANSPORT not in {"stdio", "streamable-http"}:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Unsupported TRANSPORT: {TRANSPORT}")

    # don't use sse! it is deprecated!
    if TRANSPORT == "stdio":
        # stdio doesnâ€™t support host/port args
        mcp.run(transport=TRANSPORT)
    else:
        # For streamable-http transport, host/port are valid
        mcp.run(
            transport=TRANSPORT,
            host=HOST,
            port=PORT,
        )
```
