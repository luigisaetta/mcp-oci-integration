# MCP Oracle OCI integrations
This repository contains code and examples to help in the following tasks:
* develop MCP servers in Python
* Run MCP servers on Oracle OCI
* Integrate MCP servers with AI Agents
* Integrate MCP servers with OCI resources (ADB, Select AI, ...)
* Integrate MCP Servers running on OCI with AI Assistants like ChatGPT, Claude.ai, MS Copilot

## Develop MCP Servers in Python
The easiest way is to use the [FastMCP](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome) library.

Examples:
* in [Minimal MCP Server](./minimal_mcp_server.py) you'll find a minimal example of a server exposing two tools, with the option to protect it using JWT.
